## Profile
Being a 3rd year law student with 2 years of experience in law school, I am looking forward to exploring various laws, statutes, and legislations, and contributing my views on those explorations to the world.  
I possess a positivistic approach toward problem solving and communication, with knowledge in both legal and non-legal courses pursued.  
Currently seeking an internship where these skills can be utilised.
